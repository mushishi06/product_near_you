1. How would your design change if the data was not static (i.e updated frequently
during the day)?

Since I change to Django sqlite DB no specialy But I would like to implemente Geodjango

2. Do you think your design can handle 1000 concurrent requests per second? If not, what
would you change?

No sure, but the search can be more performant with an other DB like PostGIS or Elasticsearch
